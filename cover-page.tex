{\bf Brief statement of the problem:} The Transport Control Protocol
is the common language of the Internet, but its implicit assumptions
about the network no longer hold. Working with collaborators at MIT, I
have built three systems that make a transport protocol's assumptions
explicit. Based on this experience, my thesis is that the explicit
modeling of assumptions about network behavior and user objectives by
the transport layer allows the creation of new application behaviors,
frees network technologies to evolve, and improves the experience of
real-world applications.
